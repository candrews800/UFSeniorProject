PROJECT: Determining an Optimal Diversification Strategy

STATEMENT OF WORK:

Task 1. Develop a website that allows users to create jobs. 

	Gather up to ten sources of historical performance data. Design
	and develop user interface that allows users to select subset
	of available historical data, metric to maximize. Send chosen
	criteria to web server.

Task 2. Implement an algorithm to run a set of given jobs.
	
	Implement a function to determine several performance results
	such as total, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Implement
	job runner to run a given set of unique jobs in order to share cpu
	time. Implement algorithm to select next best option in each job
	to find the best diversification strategy. Save the best plan for
	each job criteria so jobs can be restarted.

Task 3. Provide the best known plan diversification strategy for each job.
	
	Send the current state of each job back to the website. Display the 
	best known plan's performance results as well as a graph of the plan's
	APR on a per year basis.

Task 4. Document results in final report.


DELIVERABLES:  Project deliverables will consist of:

     1. Theory and algorithms used summarized in the Final Report.

     2. Website compatible with Chrome (Version 63.0), source code 
        in JavaScript, Node (Version 7.7), MySQL Community Server (Version 5.7.20).

     3. Final Report, to be written in Microsoft Word compatible electronic format.
